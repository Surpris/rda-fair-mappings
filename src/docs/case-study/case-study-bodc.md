Mapping BODC P01 Parameter Usage Vocabulary to atomic components using the I-ADOPT ontology.

### Domain

Mainly marine with some overlap with atmospheric, terrestrial, molecular, and engineering domains.

### Purpose of the mapping

Semantic interoperability, Data integration.

### Other purpose of the mapping

None given.

### Type of mapped resources

- SKOS concepts such as e.g. [Concentration of oxygen {O2 CAS 7782-44-7} per unit mass of the water body [dissolved plus reactive particulate phase]](https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P01/current/DOXMZZXX/?_profile=iop&_mediatype=text/html).

### Links to an existing mappings

- [https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/mapping/I/1740186/](https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/mapping/I/1740186/)

### Tools used for creating the mapping
