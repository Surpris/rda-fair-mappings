Mapping ICOS observables to CF convention controlled vocabulary.

### Domain

Earth and environmental sciences.

### Purpose of the mapping

Semantic interoperability, Discovery, Data integration.

### Other purpose of the mapping

None.

### Type of mapped resources

Example: We have ICOS-created definitions for tabular dataset column names (e.g. used for time series of observations), such as [Fc_1_1_1](http://meta.icos-cp.eu/resources/cpmeta/Fc_1_1_1), which refers to "carbon dioxide (CO2) flux [Âµmol m-2 s-1]" as measured at ecosystem stations. These column names are cross-connected to a set of basic (again ICOS-created) quantity kinds, such as [mass flow rate](http://meta.icos-cp.eu/resources/cpmeta/massFlowRate). In order to make the datasets more Findable (as well as Interoperable and Reusable), we are now in the process of adding qualified references for all of these variable-connected ICOS-created definitions to  sustainable and trustworthy external semantic resources, such as controlled vocabularies (e.g. the Climate and Forecasting Convention and QUDT), by adding links to concepts and appropriate SKOS-supported statements.

### Links to an existing mappings

TBD.

### Tools used for creating the mapping

At the moment, this is a manual effort.

### Type of mapping relations

- Qualified references, including "exact match", "close match", broader and narrower concepts etc.

### Examples (samples) of different types of mapping implementations

TBD.
