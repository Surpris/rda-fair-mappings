Express which specification was used when mapping in general, but this case study is to be able to express that a mapping has been done based on I-ADOPT

### Domain

Potentially any domain, but with an initinal focus on environmental domain

### Purpose of the mapping

Semantic interoperability, Data integration.

### Other purpose of the mapping

None given.

### Type of mapped resources

- SKOS concepts about variables (observable properties) mapped based on the I-ADOPT Framework ontology. This case study has different user stories:

**Use case 1: direct mappings of description components**



### Links to an existing mappings

### Type of mapping relations

- entity mappings, one-to-one.

### Examples (samples) of different types of mapping implementations
